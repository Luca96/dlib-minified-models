# Dlib Minified Models
A set of __minified__ (but still accurate) models for the Dlib library.

These models are particularly suitable for __mobile application__ thanks to the __reduced size__ of the models, and the increased inference speed.

List of available models, by category:

* **face_landmarks:** contains models to detect various sets of facial landmarks.
	* `FL68`: full face 68 landmarks; more efficient version of the Dlib detector.
	* `EE22`: 22 landmarks of eyes and eyebrows.
	* `NM30`: 30 landmarks of nose and mouth.
	* `FC17`: 17 landmarks of the face contour.
	* `WFLW98`: 98 landmarks, full face, trained on the [WLFW dataset](https://wywu.github.io/projects/LAB/WFLW.html).
