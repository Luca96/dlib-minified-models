# Contributing
Contributions are welcome, but only **Dlib shape-predictors** models are accepted.

If you want to share your model, just submit a **pull-request** with:
- An explanation of what your model recognize, along with the accuracy of the model
- A couple of example images (with detected points, bounding-box, etc)
- The steps to replicate your work (e.g. the used datasets, training script, training parameters, etc).

> Submitted models should be **zipped**: the preferred method is **bzip2**.

Every new model should fall into a **category** folder, so if it doesn't exists just create it and upload the model inside. For example, `/face_landmarks` is the category for models able to localize facial landmarks.
